Here’s a suggested prompt to move the project forward, focusing on finalizing the WebSocket integration and ensuring the messaging features work correctly on the frontend. This can be given to an AI assistant or used internally as a requirements document:

---

## Prompt

We have an existing real-time messaging system using a local WebSocket server (via “ws”), along with a REST API for retrieving channels, messages, and workspace data. We want to complete the integration so that messages, edits, and other chat-related events flow correctly between client and server in real time.

Currently:  
• Our backend WebSocket server (MessageServer) supports basic “subscribe” and “unsubscribe” actions for public channels.  
• We can store new incoming messages in the database and broadcast them to connected subscribers.  
• We do not have AWS-based infrastructure yet (e.g., AppSync, API Gateway), but we’re eventually aiming for AWS compliance.  
• The frontend has a simple chat interface that fetches messages via REST endpoints but doesn’t yet integrate fully with websockets for real-time updates.

### What We Need to Finalize

1. Frontend WebSocket Connection & Subscription Flow
   - Establish a WebSocket connection when the user loads the chat interface.  
   - Implement a “subscribe” action for the channel or DM the user is viewing.  
   - On route changes (switching channels/DMs), unsubscribe from the old channel and subscribe to the new one.  
   - Listen for WebSocket “message” events to reflect new and updated messages in the UI immediately.  

2. Ensuring Real-Time UI Updates
   - Whenever a “message” event arrives over the WebSocket, update the local state.  
   - If the channel is currently open in the UI, append it to the message list or replace the existing message if it’s an update.  
   - If the user is not currently in that channel, show an unread notification badge on the channel in the sidebar.  

3. WebSocket Message Sending (Client → Server)
   - For sending new chat messages from the client, switch from a purely REST-based POST to a WebSocket “message” action (or do both).  
   - When the WebSocket “message” action is sent, the server saves it in the database, then broadcasts it back.  
   - Ensure the client’s local chat state immediately reflects the new message (optimistic UI) or after confirmation from the server.  

4. Handling Edits, Reactions, and Other Real-Time Events
   - Add WebSocket actions (e.g., “edit”, “addReaction”, “removeReaction”) to update existing messages.  
   - On the server, update the appropriate message record, then broadcast an event to all subscribers so they can update that message’s content or reaction count.  

5. Error & Disconnect Handling
   - Implement auto-reconnect logic for the WebSocket on the client.  
   - Queue outgoing messages if the connection is lost. Upon reconnect, flush the queue so no data is lost.  
   - Display an error indicator in the UI if the server is unreachable or if a particular WebSocket action fails.  

6. Permissions & Private Channels
   - Expand the “subscribe” logic to check if the channel is private. If so, verify membership before allowing subscription.  
   - Return an error for unauthorized subscriptions or sending messages to a channel the user doesn’t belong to.  

7. AWS Readiness (Optional Next Step)
   - If we want to integrate with AWS AppSync or API Gateway WebSocket, consider replacing or augmenting the existing “ws” server.  
   - Adapt the code so that each WebSocket action is compatible with AWS’s routing messages.  
   - Use signed credentials so connections remain authenticated based on user sessions.  

### Desired Outcome

By completing these steps, we’ll have a frontend that automatically listens to new messages (and other events) in real time, updates the user interface, and handles channel/DM navigation—including subscribing and unsubscribing from channels. We also want robust error handling for disconnections and a consistent approach to permission checks for private channels.

The end result:  
• A fully functional chat interface where messages appear instantly for all participants.  
• The ability to edit or add reactions to messages, with changes reflected in real time.  
• Automatic reconnection if the WebSocket drops.  
• A foundation that can later be transitioned to AWS-compatible WebSocket solutions.
